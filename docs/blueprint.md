## Core Features:

- SEO metadata loading: Load all SEO metadata, including title, description, and keywords, from structured JSON files to ensure optimal search engine visibility and content discoverability.
- Landing page content loading: Enable dynamic content loading for landing page sections (Hero, About, Services, etc.) by sourcing data from JSON files, allowing for easy content updates and maintenance.
- Form endpoint selector: Allow the user to POST the contact form submission to a URL specified via JSON configuration, or else by setting an environment variable. In the absence of either, display a warning, rather than enabling submissions to a null endpoint.
- Image variant suggestion: Analyze user-provided images and suggest appropriate alternative text (alt text) that will act as a tool in boosting SEO performance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft terracotta (#E07A5F) to evoke warmth and grounding, relating to themes of art and earth.
- Background color: Light beige (#F8F0E3), a desaturated tone from the primary, provides a calm and inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted sage green (#93B1A7) to create a subtle, natural contrast and connect to themes of mental wellness.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' a serif typeface for an elegant feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif typeface is recommended for the body text, and 'Playfair' for the headings.
- Use minimalist line icons for services and navigation to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.
- Employ a spacious and balanced layout, ensuring readability and a sense of tranquility through ample white space.
